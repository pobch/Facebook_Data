# Facebook_Data
### Question: What time of the day are Thai people most active on Facebook?  
I tried to answer this question by collecting and analizing data from many famous Facebook pages in Thailand (each page has 500,000 - 3,000,000 fan-pages).

In this repo, there are :
- A Python script to hourly scrape data of famous Thai pages by connecting to Facebook Graph API. 
- A Python script for cleaning data.
- R scripts for wrangling and visualizing data.
- Results

This is my first personal project. If anyone has any advice/comment/feedback, please dont't hesitate to tell me. THX :)
